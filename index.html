            <p>
                The Earth’s energy budget is the most basic physical constraint on the state of climate. It is a complex system of radiative energy with numerous components such as greenhouse gas, clouds and aerosols. Fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind it from a theoretical perspective is important. It is also important for improving climate models to quantify climate change impacts. The balance between net incoming insolation and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR)  determines the gain or loss of energy in the climate system, and thus the climate state of Earth. My research focus is Earth’s energy budget, especially the change in OLR at the top of the atmosphere.<br><br>
Climate change presents a formidable challenge due to its global scale and significant uncertainty, making it difficult for individuals and local governments to take effective countermeasures. Climate system studies can offer a direct link between academic progress and societal impact, empowering communities with robust knowledge and risk assessment tools to facilitate better decision-making and discussions. My future goal is to become a climate scientist capable of providing scientifically informed opinions and recommendations to guide individuals and societies in addressing changes in Earth’s energy and climate change.
